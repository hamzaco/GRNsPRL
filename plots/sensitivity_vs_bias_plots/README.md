histrograms_2D.py: Plots 2D histograms of sensitivity vs. activity bias plots with their frequencies.

random_symmetric_nodes_two_classes: Generates random symmetric boolean function with 2 symmetry classes and plot their sensitivity and activity biases.

sensitivity_vs_activity_bias: Plots sens_vs_bias plots for both random and original networks

two_symmetry_class_full_curve: Generates the sensitivity vs activity bias plots for 3 different types of functions with 2 symmetry classes.
Types are as follows: (and) or (and), or or (and), (and) or or
