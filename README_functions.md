Descriptions of py files:

canalizing_node_analysis: Calculates the canalizing percentages in original networks.

checking_the_accuracy_two_class: Check the accuracy of analytical closed form dependencies of activity bias and sensitivity of the functions with 2-symmetry classes.

gene_behaviours_analysis: Check the conflicting signals and xor-kind behaviour in networks.

number_of_symmetric_functions: Calculates the total number of symmetric and partially symmetric functions with any given partition and displays all in a table.

original_sensitivity_calculation: Calculates sensitivities of original networks.

random_sensitivities_calculation: Calculates sensitivities of random networks.

sens_vs_bias_calculation: calculates sensitivities and activity biases of all individual genes in original networks.

sensitivity_distribution_for_fixed_input_size: Plots the sensitivity distribution for every input size in original networks.
